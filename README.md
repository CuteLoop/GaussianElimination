Gaussian Elimination
=====================
Basic algorithms are implemented in C
* Solving a linear system by Gaussian Elimination without Pivoting
* LU - decomposition "in place" where L and U are placed directly in A
* A number of useful helper functions (norms, distances, creation and destruction of matrices, random matrix generation)
